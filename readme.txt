The plugin that will insanely boost your SEO.
Stop writing bullshit just to fill in some keywords.
Be awesome with Samuweb Related Questions!

== Description ==
Imagine how users would search to find your post.
Instead of putting these keywords directly in your text (and making it a crap), just select the text that will be the "answer" to the "question" that your users are making.
The plugin generates a box (that you can put it discretely somewhere in your page) with all the questions.
When the user clicks the question, it scrolls and highlights the answer.

== Installation ==
1. Go to your post. You'll notice a new icon.
2. Select the text you want to be the answer to your question and click the icon.
3. Put the <strong>Samuweb Related Questions</strong> box wherever you want in your theme.
If you're lazy like me, just copy and paste from here:</p>
`<div id="samuweb-related-questions-box"></div>`
4.That's all, folks! You're ready to rock!
And the best thing: it's so light that it doesn't even need jQuery

== Screenshots ==
1. The new icon on your text editor
